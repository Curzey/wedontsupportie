Repo for all the great things you can do without IE in your life.

## Ideas
- **Full screen editor**
  - Folder structure, editor view, (JS: console, CSS: browser window - this "window" should be resizable).
- **Category(CSS/JS) switcher**
  - Skewed code editors, straight on hover/click. Description next to code editor.
*(both has global search fields)*

## Inspiration
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-dk)
- 30 seconds of knowledge layout with split markup editors.
